# Kotlin Reduce Function Error: Missing Initial Value

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `reduce` function in Kotlin collections. The `reduce` function requires an initial value when operating on lists that can be empty.  Failure to provide this leads to a runtime exception.

The `bug.kt` file shows the erroneous code and the `bugSolution.kt` provides the corrected implementation.
